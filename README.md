A 3D Rolling Puzzle Platformer (if that genre even exists) made in Unreal Engine 4. The main purpose of this project is for me to learn the basics of everything that the engine has to offer all while using my Computer Graphics course as an excuse to spend multiple hours each day making a video game instead of studying maths.
